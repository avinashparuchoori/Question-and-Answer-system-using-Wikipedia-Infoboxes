'''''300''''' is a 2007 American [[action film]] based on the 1998 comic series [[300 (comics)|of the same name]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Lynn Varley]]. Both are fictionalized retellings of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. The film was directed by [[Zack Snyder]], while Miller served as [[executive producer]] and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a [[Superimposition|super-imposition]] [[chroma key]] technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book.

The plot revolves around [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] ([[Gerard Butler]]), who leads 300 [[Sparta]]ns into battle against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Divine king|"god-King"]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and his army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] ([[Lena Headey]]) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a [[voice-over]] narrative by the Spartan soldier [[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Dilios]] ([[David Wenham]]). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing ''300'' within the genre of [[historical fantasy]].

''300'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[HD DVD]] on July 31, 2007. The film received mixed reviews, receiving acclaim for its original visuals and style, but criticism for favoring visuals over [[Characterisation|characterization]] and its controversial depiction of the ancient [[Persian People|Persians]]; however, the film was a box office success, grossing over $450 million, with the film's opening being the 24th largest in [[box office]] history at the time, and it has since developed a cult following.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot of 300 or every funny quote does not belong here. Quotations such as "THIS IS SPARTA!!" or "PREPARE FOR BATTLE!" are not necessary or encyclopedic. --&gt;

Dilios, a Spartan soldier, narrates the story of [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] from his boyhood to becoming a king of [[Sparta]]. Thirty years later, a Persian messenger arrives at the gates of Sparta, demanding the submission of Sparta to [[Xerxes I of Persia|King Xerxes]]. In response to this demand, Leonidas kicks the messenger into a large well. Knowing this will prompt a Persian attack, Leonidas visits the [[Ephor]]s—ancient [[leprosy]]-ridden priests whose blessing he needs before the Spartan council will authorize going to war. He proposes they repel the numerically superior [[persian people|Persians]] by using the terrain of [[Thermopylae]] (the Hot Gates) and funneling the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea. The Ephors consult the [[Pythia|Oracle]], who decrees that Sparta must not go to war during their religious festival [[Carnea]]. As Leonidas departs, two agents of Xerxes appear—one of them, Theron, a Spartan—who bribe the Ephors with concubines and money.

Leonidas follows his plan anyway, setting out with only 300 soldiers, whom he calls his personal guards to avoid needing the council's permission. Though he regards the mission as certain suicide, he hopes the sacrifice will spur the council to unite against Persia. On the way to Thermopylae, [[Arcadia]]ns join the Spartans. At Thermopylae they construct a wall to contain the approaching Persians. As construction goes on, Leonidas meets [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a hunchbacked Spartan in exile whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain [[Sparta#Birth and death|infanticide]]. Wanting to redeem his father's name, Ephialtes asks to join the fight; he warns Leonidas of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround them. Though Leonidas sympathizes with Ephialtes's will to fight, he turns him down, as Ephialtes cannot properly hold a shield: this would compromise the Spartans' [[phalanx formation]].

Before the battle, the Persian Captain demands that the Spartans lay down their weapons. Leonidas [[Molon labe|refuses]], and the Spartans successfully repel the ensuing Persian assault, using their superior martial skills and the tightly-knit phalanx formation. Xerxes personally parleys with Leonidas, offering him wealth and power in exchange for his loyalty and surrender. Leonidas declines, and Xerxes sends his elite guard, the formidable [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], to attack, but the Spartans successfully dispatch them, suffering a few casualties of their own. Xerxes then sends a number of exotic weapons at the Spartans, including black powder bombs and [[war elephants]], but all of these attacks fail. During these attacks, Astinos is killed, which drives his father Captain Artemis into a fit of rage.

Angered by Leonidas's rejection, Ephialtes defects to the Persians and informs them of the secret path. When they realize Ephialtes's treachery, the Arcadians retreat, and Leonidas orders Dilios to return to Sparta to tell the Council of their sacrifice. Though Dilios had recently injured his left eye in combat, he is still fit for battle, but Leonidas decides to use Dilios's gift for storytelling to appeal to the Spartan council. Though reluctant to leave his brothers behind, Dilios leaves with the Arcadians.

In Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]], Leonidas' wife, agrees to a sexual encounter with Theron, before which he promises his help in persuading the Spartan council to send reinforcements to Leonidas. However, following her address to the Council, Theron publicly betrays the Queen by accusing her of adultery, prompting the councilmen to cry out in outrage and Gorgo to kill him in a fit of anger. The [[xiphos]] that Gorgo uses to kill Theron pierces his purse, spilling Persian coins from his robe, revealing his role as traitor, and the Council agrees to unite against Persia.

At Thermopylae, the Persians use the goat path to outflank the Spartans. Xerxes's general demands their surrender, again offering Leonidas titles and prestige. Leonidas seemingly bows in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general instead. Furious, Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas rises and hurls his spear at Xerxes, cutting the King on the cheek, thus fulfilling an earlier promise to "make the [[Divine king|God-King]] bleed". Visibly disturbed by this reminder of his mortality, Xerxes watches as a massive barrage of arrows kills all the Spartans. Moments before his death, Leonidas pledges his undying love to Gorgo.

Concluding his tale before an audience of Spartans on the edge of the battlefield a year after Thermopylae, Dilios relates how the Persian army has suffered desertions, out of fear and the heavy casualties they suffered at the hands of a mere 300 Spartans. Word of their valiant resistance spread across Greece, inspiring the different city-states to unite against the Persians. Now, the Persians face 10,000 Spartans leading 30,000 free Greeks. Although still outnumbered three to one, Dilios declares that the Greeks shall be victorious and praises the sacrifice of the 300. He then leads the Greeks in a charge against the Persian army at the [[Battle of Plataea]], the battle that would end Persia's invasion of Greece.

The film is a [[shot-for-shot adaptation]] of the [[comic book]], similar to the film adaptation of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stax |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/641/641893p1.html|title=Attila Leads the ''300'' |publisher=IGN |date=August 15, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots.

Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal "Frank Miller world" of ''300'' was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, he is able to introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that "Dilios is a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth."&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{cite news|author=Resa Nelson |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=34442 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080610064002/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=34442 |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |title=''300'' Mixes History, Fantasy |work=Sci Fi Wire |date=February 1, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder also added the [[Subplot|sub-plot]] in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.&lt;ref name="sharp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics2film.com/StoryFrame.php?f_id=21972 |title=Zack Snyder on keeping ''300'' sharp |accessdate= March 22, 2007 |author=Chris Brown |date=September 9, 2006 |work=Comics2Film.com |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comics2film.com%2FStoryFrame.php%3Ff_id%3D21972&amp;date=2008-09-28 |archivedate=September 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months of [[pre-production]] were required to create hundreds of shields, spears, and swords, some of which were recycled from ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' and ''[[Alexander (film)|Alexander]]''. Creatures were designed by [[Jordu Schell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.surrealaward.com/avatar/bioschellj.shtml | title = Jordu Schell: Avatar Lead Characters Designer | work = Avatar Movie Zone | accessdate = April 20, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers. Shaun Smith and [[Mark Rappaport (creature effects artist)|Mark Rappaport]] worked hand in hand with Snyder in pre-production to design the look of the individual characters, and to produce the prosthetics, props, weapons and dummy bodies required for the production.&lt;ref name="SHH set visit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Douglas Edward |title=''300'': The Set Visit! |work=SuperHeroHype.com |date=January 5, 2007 |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/300news.php?id=5064 |accessdate=March 17, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070317195944/http://www.superherohype.com/news/300news.php?id=5064| archivedate= March 17, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler said that while he did not feel constrained by Snyder's direction, fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance.

[[Post-production]] was handled by Montreal's Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies filled in the bluescreen footage with more than 1,500 [[visual effects]] shots. [[Visual effects supervisor]], [[Chris Watts]], and [[production designer]], Jim Bissell, created a process dubbed "The Crush,"&lt;ref name="SHH set visit" /&gt; which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark. Certain sequences were [[Saturation (color theory)|desaturated]] and tinted to establish different moods.
